# The Best App is No App At All

Lately, I've been thinking more and more about my role with technology.

- conflict: love tech and feel it can change the world, but recognize that the noise in our tech culture can distract us from the important things in life, and decrease our happiness

So the postulate is that the best app is the one that fades into the background -- the one that works into your every day and whose creators don't define success as taking more and more of your attention. Every app creator should feel that their duty is first and foremost to provide and good while preserving your most precious commodity, your time.

And app should be as minimal as possible -- introducing as little new technology and neutral behavioral change as possible. I say "neutral behvioural change", because often a good app will attempt to change your behavior for the better. Like if aThere's nothing wrong with that. And if you can look at your problem and determine that it can be solved with existing tools or using no new technology, then THAT is ideal.

And this kinda tips things on their head, as most apps seem to define success as being able to monopolize and shape more and more of your life. We measure success as engagement. I get a ping for each thing that happens on Facebook, and when I read every one, I would imagine Facebook takes that as a success. But is it?

Example: JIRA
Don't get me wrong: I love JIRA. It provides ridiculous amounts of flexibility in project management. But it's already more overhead. Another dashboard to check; another link to cross-reference; another thing to integrate into your other tools without the goal of ignoring it, but with the goal of spreading your limited attention into into another domain.

While I haven't had time to dive into it as much as I'd like to, I really appreciate the angle that Sprint.ly takes. It seems to recognize that a project management tool can essentially just be a read-only interface; an aggregator. Especially with technology, everything is already tracked somewhere, whether that's github pushes or commit messages or jenkins job running deploys or emails to/from clients. Sprintly seems to be moving toward a world where you can track and update task status from commit messages and merges, forward client emails to create and update tasks, and visualize progress by analyzing this body of data that's currently just floating in the ether around each productive team.

Coding Horror article quote:

> Every time you write new code, you should do so reluctantly, under duress, because you completely exhausted all your other options.

I'd really love to see more apps and technology services take this approach to heart. We should be iterating technologies not to engage more, but to allow for more distance -- to allow people to forget they're even subscribed to a service until they consider unsubscribing, and realize how often they take it for granted.

For instance, Facebook check-ins: While there are benefits, like being able to see what close friends are ding around you, each check-in takes you out of a moment of living. And conversely, checking. So if there's a purpose to check-in aside from building user profiles for selling business intelligence service -- if the purpose is help REAL users live happier lives -- then check-ins need to adjust focus. For instance, how can Facebook more intelligently and effortlessly allow me to be notified when friends around are doing something, so that I can go and actively participate in person? And how can they make it a dead-simple, one-button effort to check in, even when reception is bad? Or perhaps a one-button check-in, but make it simple to add people later, or tag a specific venue later on. After all, if Facebook is claiming to help me engage in real world social activity, it shouldn't just be about showing me timelines. I would love it if they made it a priority to see every new feature through the lens of improving my SOCIAL life.
