Does the customer need to actually be present to pour the yeast, or with sufficient automation of the process, can they simply initiate the process remotely. Further, can a partner business store the brewed beer and provide it to designated customers who enter to use the "tab".

Edit: The FAQ seems to indicate that serving would never be allowed. It would also seem that the person needs to be physically present, but it might be worth inquiring whether this is still true if the process is totally automated and no one is involved.

It might still be an interesting project to poke holes in the system. For instance, if I make a homebrewing setup that is totally automated, and then allow people to click a button to initiate the brewing of the beer that I will consume, is this still illegal? Also, what if I have a club with paid membership dues, and I give all members access to my setup -- is this still illegal?

This is interesting: http://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/3186/is-homebrewing-beer-legal-in-ontario-canada
