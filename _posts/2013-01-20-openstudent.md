# openStudent: agiley-developed, open student management system fighting status quo

I recently [heard on Hacker News][hn-post] about a small Canadian school board that, against the backdrop of many doubters, had [kickstarted a project to develop its own open source student management system][article]. They were told that their small student body couldn't possibly support its development, but they hired an internal development team and got to work anyhow. They were banking that in the long term, the software would save the BC education system hundred of millions of dollars in licensing fees.

As a developer working at [Myplanet][myplanet-site], where we strive to follow agile development methodologies, I find their development strategy particularly exciting. According to the [project website][project-website], they've been working on weekly development sprints, and chronicling their sprint progress publicly. It appears that they're not being quite so diligent with sharing the code yet, as only a few stale project repositories are [available on GitHub][github-repo]. Perhaps they simply don't realize the potential for a community of contributors to surface. The whole shabang around this project seems pretty unprecedented, so I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt for now.

Despite the semblance of success that the semi-opensource project has garnered, it seems there are still some in the BC Ministry of Education who are still favouring an upcoming commercial solutions, according to the Times Colonial article. Pearson is no doubt planning to expend lots of resources ensuring that it wins the RFP for the successor to its own product.

The [openStudent Business Plan][business-plan] (p. 6) also hints at some curious forces that might be working against the success of the project, particularly in relation to BCeSIS, the official tool that the BC Ministry of Education is putting its weight behind:

> As we now know, [...] Pearson Education, will discontinue BCeSIS by December 2015. Pearson’s motivations are quite clear - they wish to win the Ministry’s RFP competition and have all existing districts move to their flagship product, Powerschool.

Powerschool, [as a little digging reveals][wiki-powerschool], was transferred from Apple to Pearson several years ago. As explained in the BC Teachers' Federation [Gutstein-Pearson Report][pearson-report] (p. 16), part of this deal was that Pearson would continue to develop content for the iPod, and subsequently the iPad and iPhone. For those wary of Apple's approach to growing their walled garden ecosystem, it's easy to see how a move toward an open source solution might alienate these two big players in BC's education future. I simply can't imagine they're holding back in exerting their clout, likely dangling all sorts of carrots in front of the Minstry of Education.
