# pair coding our way peak physical condition

Back in 2007, I spent a summer working as the head of maintenance at a driving range. Prior to that summer, I might have assumed that manual labour was mind-numbing banal work, and below my talents. But over the course of that summer, I realized that manual labour was the perfect time to think through challenging mental problems. Not only did I have hours each day to articulate my personal values and contemplate possible solutions for problems I encountered in the wider world, but I also found myself arriving at my peak physical condition, which gave me a very positive lens on the world and my ability to make change within it. I truly came to carry myself differently, and while I can't find the time for as much physical activity lately, I still hold manual labour in high esteem.

In the intervening years, I've found myself working more and more as a coder, and its given me a bit of an existential crisis. I recognize that programming skills are intellectually empowering, as they provide me the means to affect the world around me in almost any way that technology can. But having said that, I don't find myself physicallyu empowered. I'm bursting with enthusiasm about the intangible digital solutions I'm well heeled to tackle, but I'm desperately conflicted that my chosen path cannot seem to provide me with the tangible satisfaction of improving my physical self. It's often seemed to me that the metrics for these two brands of personal success that I value dearly, will perpetually be at odds -- I cannot improve my intellectual digital skills without them distracting me from my fitness goals and vying for my limited resources.

This was something I had been coming to accept until recently, when I was inspired by the folks at Pivotal Labs to dive into the philosophy of pair coding. I'd heard tell of pair coding, and even experimented with it briefly at Myplanet Digital, but my understanding was that it was an intermittent tool used to troubleshoot and teach newcomers. I hadn't probed deeply until hearing how the Pivots operated. At Pivotal Labs, they're very regimented about essentially ALL coding being done in pairs, and they switch partners constantly. Stimulated by this realization, I picked up a copy of [The Art of Agile Development](http://www.amazon.com/The-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675) and started reading up on pair coding principles.

- 2 roles, driver and navigator. Driver is the person typing, and navigator is the person doing most of the big-picture thinking. The book makes a point of mentioning that the programmer in the driver's seat will often feel slow-witted compared to the thinker doing the navigating, and that's to be expected, as this person is freed from the minutae of coding, and can defer this to the driver. Sometimes the navigator might find it more natural to stand and move about.

And this got me thinking. If the navigator is simply a thinker, and no longer locked into a stationary posture, what's to stop them for engaging in active behaviour.

So lately, I've been thinking on how it might be possible to incorporate cardio activity into the pair programming experience. My first thought was that this could somehow involve a stationary bike, where a fitness metric must be maintained or else the navigator's system will lock up or become less responsive in some way. Further, it would seem that it could be possible to write a plugin for an IDE that helped manage various sorts of digitized work tools -- a treadmill or maybe even a free weight system of some sort.

Progressive employers like Myplanet are already allocating company time for health and wellness. But in the current state of things, it's more like an add-on that's tacked onto the employee experience -- the idea is that we stop doing productive work to be healthy, because we understand that in the fuzzy long-run, it's better for both ourselves and the company. But sometimes it's all too easy to skip the wellness excercises to focus on that pesky coding problem just a little bit longer. We don't want to remove ourselves from the flow that we're in. But what if fitness was in our flow -- if it was a intergral part of of our routine for developing awesome applications? And how amazing would it be to know that whe you were going into work each day, you were not only going to build great products, but build a better *you*. Yeah, it sounds cheesey, but also pretty damn exciting.

Could the definition of done for a story on a team also involve personal criteria around target heart-rates acheieved during the completion of stories?

Steps to get there:
  - Begin a pair coding regiment at Myplanet.
  - Navigators should try biking as they work to iron out kinks and test feasability.
  - Write a simple app to lock the screen under a certain criteria, likely involving an arduino somehow tracking activity on a the bike in ome boolean fashion -- ie. is the navigator pedaling or not?
  - Make sensor apparatus more robust to clock speed.
  - Make app more robust to warn/countdown when hitting threshold.
