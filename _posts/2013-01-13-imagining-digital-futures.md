# imagining digital futures

Despite being deeply embedded in a technological culture, I'm often torn by my enthusiasm for technological solutions and my apprehension about the things we lose when going digital.

For instance, I love the idea of e-books. I'm a minimalist, so the idea of unburdening my life -- replacing dozens of items with a single one -- is appealing. I also like that the consumption of literature is theoretically less wasteful without objects crafted from pulp fibers. On the other hand, I'm also aware of the things we currently give up in the transition: the simplicity of flipping through a book to skim and absorb information; the fluidity of ownership which is destroyed by the prevailing digital copy-protection (a.k.a. DRM); the ease of saving interesting bits for later, by dog-earing pages and annotating passages; and yes, even the self-indulgent thrill of accumulating a bookshelf that in some small way helps describe to houseguests who you are and what you value.

But I prefer not to spend my mental energies waxing sentimental among the cult of the physical, and instead focus on imagining how the digital might be able to bridge its shortcomings. Often I do this by imagining ideal futures:

*I arrive home about 15 minutes before some friends are supposed to arrive. As I approach my apartment, the front door [senses my phone's bluetooth signal and unlocks][lockitron]. I enter the main room, and the LCD on my wall has also powered on to display my personal dashboard, incorporating a few pieces of information that I like keep tabs on, particularly my finances and various [health][withings] [stats][fitbit]. I [update a few uncategorized purchases][mint] from earlier that day so that I don't forget before my monthly budgeting, and make note that my friend Erin is totally [kicking my ass in kilometer run this week][runkeeper]. I flip the dashboard to bookshelf mode, and jump into the kitchen to start making the food that's currently in my slowcooker look presentable.*

*I'm still working away when Liam and Shannon knock on the front door. I quickly invite them into the living room and then dash back into the kitchen. I carry on a conversation with Liam, as Shannon idly pokes through my digital bookshelf. She comes in a few minutes later, asking who this "Cory Doctorow" dude is, because there's a bunch of his stuff on the shelf. I excitedly abandon the half-prepared dinner for a moment and tap my tablet against a cover image on the dashboard for "Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom". It transfers and I quickly flip through and hone in on some choice excerpts which hint at some awesome sci-fi concepts in futurism. I insist that she needs to read the book, and so we bump tablets and transfer the content. Leaning over her shoulder, I encourage her to flip toward the "Author & Related Content" section at the back, where there's a photo, a quick bio, and some thumbnail links to his most popular video blogs. I tell her that the author is from Toronto and a seriously ingenious futurist who's totally worth looking into. I remind her that if she likes the book she should definitely send him a direct tip through the e-book's quick-link. Having said my piece, I go back into the kitchen and Shannon and Liam follow, asking whether there's anything that they can do to help.*

I like this sort of thought experiment in optimism, but these idealized futures can sometimes seem a long way off. But at least in the case of e-books, some of these dilemmas [are][ebook-interface] [already][ebook-shelf] [being][ebook-non-drm] [solved][ebook-sbook].
