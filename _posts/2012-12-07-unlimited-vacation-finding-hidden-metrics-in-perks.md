# unlimited vacation: finding hidden metrics in perks

Unlimited vacation. It's one of those ideas so crazy that it just might work, like *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea on Ice*, or any suggestion by B. A. Baracus. I'd never heard of it until [@kennethreitz](https://twitter.com/kennethreitz) gave everyone [a peak into the Pandora's Box that is Heroku's company perk list](http://kennethreitz.com/on-heroku-and-2012.html).

[Over on Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4874743), there seemed to be quite a few people who thought it a poor idea. It almost seemed like only Heroku employees were defending it. The critiques seemed to be:

- "Obviously there's an unspoken upper limit, so just be honest about what that is so people don't unfairly under-utilize it," and
- "The best people will be conservative and work too hard, so you're punishing them by imposing a system that takes advantage of their good nature."

I'll be candid -- I think it's an awesome idea; almost as good as *20,000 Leagues Under the Sea on Ice*. And this is largely because I'm becoming fond of searching for social metrics of organizational health, and this one's just too perfect.

To provide context, lately I'm feeling like [@jezhumble](https://twitter.com/jezhumble)'s [*Continuous Delivery* book]() has given me superpowers outside the intended realms of automation and build process design. In particular, there's this encapsulating one-liner that is probably closer to a working mantra than anything else I've got:

> Bring the pain forward.

The idea in the context of software development is that when something is shitty, you should do it more often.

"Releasing sucks, huh? You mean it sucks so hard that you need to throw a party afterward just to regain your zest for life? Cool story, bro. So then let's aim to release on *every commit*."

To be fair, Jez doesn't say it like that. I don't think he's ever chided a bro for a sub-par narative. But what he's saying in a more general sense, is this: **When something you do surfaces something baser that you don't like, don't avoid the first thing, but embrace it.** And interestingly, this is much more widely applicable outside software development.

So back to "unlimited vacation". What intrigues me is that, aside from being a killer perk, it's one of those perfect social metrics that can surface something important about a company's culture.

Let's say that your employees are taking *too much* vacation. In this case, an unlimited vacation policy has correctly functioned as a litmus test, telling you that you're either hiring the wrong type of people, or you're creating an environment that the perfect people need to escape.

On the other hand, what if your employees are taking *too little* vacation -- What does this say about them? Ah, and here's the *M. Night Shyamalan*: It says nothing necessarily bad about them. The most important thing is reveals is about the *organization*: It's a test of how compassionate a company is. Because if you're running an outfit that's allowing people to burn themselves out, then you're doing it wrong. You need to fix your shit, pronto.

So as far as I'm concerned, every company concerned with building a culture of trust and compassion should at least experiment with unlimited vacations. I'm sure there are plenty of other standard practices that similarly mask effective indicators of company health. And if we leave these things unchallenged, we're missing out on a powerful set of checks and balances. And maybe some cool perks too.
